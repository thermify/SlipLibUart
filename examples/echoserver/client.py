"""
Client
++++++

The :file:`client.py` example file is a client for the demonstrator echo server .
It prompts the user for a message,
encodes it in a Slip packet, sends it to the server,
and prints the decoded reply it gets back from the server.
This is repeated until the user enters an empty message.
