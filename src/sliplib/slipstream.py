    """Class that wraps an IO stream with a :class:`Driver`

    :class:`SlipStream` combines a :class:`Driver` instance with a concrete byte stream.
    The byte stream must support the methods :meth:`read` and :meth:`write`.
    To avoid conflicts and ambiguities caused by different `newline` conventions,
    streams that have an :attr:`encoding` attribute
    (such as :class:`io.StringIO` objects, or text files that are not opened in binary mode)
    are not accepted as a byte stream.

    The :class:`SlipStream` class has all the methods and attributes
    from its base class :class:`SlipWrapper`.
    In addition it directly exposes all methods and attributes of
    the contained :obj:`stream`, except for the following:

     * :meth:`read*` and :meth:`write*`. These methods are not
       supported, because byte-oriented read and write operations
       would invalidate the internal state maintained by :class:`SlipStream`.
     * Similarly, :meth:`seek`, :meth:`tell`, and :meth:`truncate` are not supported,
       because repositioning or truncating the stream would invalidate the internal state.
     * :meth:`raw`, :meth:`detach` and other methods that provide access to or manipulate
       the stream's internal data.

    In stead of the :meth:`read*` and :meth:`write*` methods
    a :class:`SlipStream` object provides the method :meth:`recv_msg` and :meth:`send_msg`
    to read and write SLIP-encoded messages.

    .. deprecated:: 0.6
       Direct access to the methods and attributes of the contained :obj:`stream`
       will be removed in version 1.0

        To instantiate a :class:`SlipStream` object, the user must provide
        a pre-constructed open byte stream that is ready for reading and/or writing

        Args:
            stream (bytestream): The byte stream that will be wrapped.

            chunk_size: the number of bytes to read per read operation.
                The default value for `chunck_size` is `io.DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE`.
                Setting the `chunk_size` is useful when the stream has a low bandwidth
                and/or bursty data (e.g. a serial port interface).
                In such cases it is useful to have a `chunk_size` of 1, to avoid that the application
                hangs or becomes unresponsive.
